== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I get an Amazon API and secret key? =

There's no cost to get an Amazon API key. Simply go to http://aws.amazon.com and register for security credentials.

= What is the shortcode to display Amazon data? =

Use this shortcode: [azr-link asin="AMAZON ASIN #"] - Obviously replace AMAZON ASIN # with the ASIN number of the product you are promoting.

= Where do I find an Amazon ASIN #? =

Scroll down the Amazon product page until you see "product details". The ASIN number should be listed there. If you are promoting a print book, you can use the ISBN-10 number instead of the ASIN number.

= What if the data isn't displaying when I save the post? =

This is most commonly caused by invalid API keys or secret keys. Please double check the keys that you usedâ€¦ If that's not the problem, please double check that you've entered the shortcode correctly.
